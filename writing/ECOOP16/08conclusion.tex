This work demonstrates the promise of ontology for overcoming the
three major limitations of today's declarative program analysis. The
four types of data analyses on PATO show that the single ontology is
able to support multiple different program analyses efficiently. The
GPU data placement experiments indicate the promise of ontology for
seamlessly linking knowledge from different sources, extending
declarative program analysis with the capability to effectively guide
program optimizations. The cooperative Liveness analysis demonstrates
that with ontology-based program analysis, cooperations among
different compilers or other program analysis tools become simple, and
the synergy turns out to be quite beneficial. Overall, the study shows
some good promise of the integration of Ontology into program
analysis. We hope that this work will prompt further investigations by
the community into this promising direction, and stimulate some
discussions in this new paradigm of program analysis.

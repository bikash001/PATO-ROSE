Program analysis is fundamental for program optimizations, debugging,
and many other tasks. But developing program analyses has been a
challenging and error-prone process for general users.  Declarative
program analysis has shown the promise to dramatically improve the
productivity in the development of program analyses. Current
declarative program analysis is however subject to some major
limitations in supporting cooperations among analysis tools, guiding
program optimizations, and often requires many efforts for repeated
program preprocessing. 

In this work, we advocate the integration of Ontology into declarative
program analysis. As a way to standardize the definitions of concepts
in a domain and the representation of the knowledge in the domain,
ontology offers a promising way to address the limitations of current
declarative program analysis.  We develop a prototype of
ontology-based program analysis framework named PATO.  Experiments on
five program analyses confirm the potential of ontology for
complementing existing declarative program analysis. It supports
multiple analyses without separate program preprocessings, promotes
cooperative Liveness analysis between two compilers, and effectively
guides a data placement optimization for Graphic Processing Units
(GPU).
